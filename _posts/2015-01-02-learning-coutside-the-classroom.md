One of the ideas that has been percolating around my brain for quite sometime now is the title of this post: Learning Outside the Classroom. In my work as a teaching assistant, talking with my classmates, thinking about future jobs and internships, this theme of learning outside of the classroom keeps coming up. I know that for me personally, I don't do enough learning outside of the classroom though I intend to. 

As an example I bought myself a [Raspberri Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) for Christmas last year to monkey around with but it is still in the box. I have everything I need to get it up and running because I bought a complete kit from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) and I even have several project ideas for it, yet it is still in the box. This is what I do.

So with the knowledge that I would have 3 weeks during winter break where I would have orders of magnitude more free time I came up with a list of things I wanted to learn, learn more about, or accomplish during the break.

2015 winter break list
======================

- make a new website using [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com)
- learn [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- use [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) instead of TextEdit
- learn more about [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
- learn more [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
- work through the [ROS](http://www.ros.org) tutorial [book](https://cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/)
- learn [Swift](http://www.swift.org)/[Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)
- learn [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- practice the [Colemak](http://www.colemak.com) keyboard layout
- create a bootable backup of my primary computer
- do a fresh install of [El Capitan](https://www.apple.com/osx/) on my primary computer

Some of these I have worked on. This post is published on my new website that was built using Jekyll. This post and my [first post]({% post_url 2015-12-30-hello-world %}) were both written in Emacs using Markdown. 

Some of these items I have not yet accomplished. Practicing and eventually switching to the Colemak layout is a long term process and I haven't done much to learn more SQL or LaTeX these last 2 weeks.

I am interested in all of the things on my list. Some of them, will benefit me in the coming semester. Some of them are related to the [The Utah Robotic Mining Project](http://roboticmining.eng.utah.edu) or to [CPUofU](http://www.cpuofu.com) which are student groups to which I belong. I believe that working through the items on this list will help me become a better programmer. Being exposed to different tools, ideas, methodologies, paradigms, programmers, and projects can only be a good thing. 

Perhaps I have been a bit too ambitious in the number of things I put on the list. There is certainly no way I canould accomplish all of them in the 3 weeks I have off of school, but I have learned a tremendous amount so far. Additionally, I will continue to work on all of these things after the break, I just won't have as much free time to do so.
