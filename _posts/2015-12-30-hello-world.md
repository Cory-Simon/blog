Welcome to Cory Simon -- the website. This is the first post.

For quite some time (read: years) I have wanted to get a blog going here. I'm not sure if this time will be any different, or if eventually this too shall pass. Whatever the future holds, this is officially the first post. Yay.

So what am I going to put here? Mostly nerdery things like code snippets, thoughts about tech, frustrations, maybe a photo or two. Honestly I am leaving it open for pretty much anything. Mostly I want this domain to be more than an email address for me. I guess we will just have to see where this goes. Welcome to the show.
