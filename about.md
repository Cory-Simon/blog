Hi! My name is Cory Simon and I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am a Computer Science student at the [University of Utah](http://cs.utah.edu) where I also work as a teaching assistant. In my spare time I enjoy learning about the art of software development, chasing my Shih Tzu around, movies, books, and exploring the [Wasatch Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range). I am continually adding to my Lego collection and love to cheer for my home soccer club [Real Salt Lake](http://realsaltlake.com).

Thanks for reading this over. At some point in the "future" I am going to have to put more stuff here. Maybe rewrite the whole thing so that I sound more interesting. Anyhow, if you need to contact me, the details are found at the bottom of this page. Thanks for reading.
